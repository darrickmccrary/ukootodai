                            <p> I was curious if anyone has any of the shows in this format? I would love to hear a show and compare it to the FLACS and MP'3 that us working folk have had to "settle for". No way I can afford the price tag right now unfortunately. Seriously though, I am Grateful for what we have. I wouldn't mind checking one of these DSD's out though if possible. First of all, here’s FiiO’s description of the product in their promo video. gt A. Industrial Design: Small and exquisite + Aluminum alloy CNCed chassis + Double-sided 2.5D in-cell tempered glass + cVc Bluetooth receiver + Easy to operate + Dual-color LED light gt B. Performance and Hardware Configuration: AK4377 + SBC/AAC/aptX/aptX-HD/LDAC/HWA + Flagship Bluetooth chip CSR8675 + No current noise + Incredible low noise floor gt Features 1) : Vivid and lively display effect Hi Guys, Just tested the Fiio M9 the last two Days and i'm very disappointed. Lets start with the positiv things first. amp#x200B; Build Quality is great as always from fiio. Android run's very smooth, didn't expect that on a DAP. amp#x200B; Negative: amp#x200B; Gapless is not working, which sucks if you hear albums like the dark side of the moon. With High Resolution Files i get some weird sounds sometime. crackle like. If i play on Windows with Foobar2000 and put the Waveform. 
The reason I have a Connect is to serve Foobar2000, and a combination of files and internet radio to 2 other rooms from a PC. The PC is connected to a Topping D10 DAC, and that goes to the Connect with a high quality RCA cable. Everything plays extremely well to the computer's monitors. So I'm using only known good sources. I swapped and tested cables to confirm they are all good. The Sonos speakers, a Playbar and a couple of Ones, sound very good using sources through the Sonos Please excuse the wall of words and my naiveté. I’m new to Foobar2000 and the subred. I have been monkeying with Foobar for a couple of days, and I’m thrilled with it. For background, I have a Topping D10 hooked up to USB, and the D10’s optical out going to a pair of Kanto YU4 speakers, and the RCA out going to a Sonos Connect that serves 2 more rooms of speakers. The D10 is a new purchase, and that’s where I got the recommendation for Foobar I got one of these DAC's, but in Windows 10, I am limited to outputting at 24/192, but the specs on Questyle's website says that it can output at 32/384: Pre-amplifier and DAC Section - THD+N: RCA:lt 0.0009%; XLR:lt 0.0009% - SNR: RCA: gt110dB; XLR: gt113dB (non-weighting) - USB Type B Input: 44.1K- 384K /16- 32Bit PCM and DSD native, DSD64 / 128 / 256 - Digital Interface: SPDIF input and output, OPT input; Support 44.1K-192K / 24Bit PCM Am I doing something wrong?. I have a Micca Origen+ currently Going from my computer via usb to Micca to Headphones I am looking to up my game. Looking for inputs for optical and usb Outputs of 1/4" and 3.5mm. 32bit and 384khz. DSD64 and DSD128. 24bit is a must also since I have a few FLAC albums @24/96 Would like to keep under 0US. I have been nagging HUAWEI about low volume on the 3.5mm adapter for a while, looks like there will be a remedy soon! "CM21" I pre-ordered one. The Sound on the P20 and P20 Pro is generally reasonably good, but lacks volume for anything over 32ohm. Only found german sepcs, sorry: Unterstützt Smartphones mit bis zu 600 Ohm starker Impedanz Frequenzreichweite: 20 Hz bis 50 KHz Eingangsspannung: 3,3 V bis 5 V (DC) Lautstärkeumfang: gt120 dB Sampling rate: Hey everyone; long time listener, first time caller. So I have very little experience with server builds and server CPUs, and I really want to build a balls-to-the-wall NAS, but I'm trying to figure out how to do that without spending money :P kidding. kind of. I'm hoping you guys can guide me to a proper CPU set up for what I'm trying to accomplish. amp#x200B; Goals: So I might soon be taking over hosting responsibilities for a music server my buddy and I have that consists of shitload. After a good search and reading many reviews I've found, IMO, a pretty good matching for my ATH-MSR7. The Fostex HP-A4 with the MUSES8920 opamp mod. I have recently decided to swap the original opamp and try out the MUSES01 and the cheaper version MUSES8920. Both sound much better than the original (Burr-Brown OPA2134PA) and pair well with the integrated DAC chip (Burr-Brown PCM1792A) The low end with the MUSES01 is not as present as with the 8920, although highs are more detailed 
Selling: Timestamps: Shipping CONUS only! I accept payment through verified Paypal or Bitcoin and will only ship to confirmed addresses. Crypto is my preferred method of payment. I am not looking for any trades. If you have any questions feel free to ask. MSI X99 Gaming 7 Motherboard - 0 shipped Motherboard is brand new and factory sealed. UPC code on box was cut out for a rebate. Sticker and door hanger not included. Audio Technica. Greetings, A little over 24 hours ago I made an impulse decision to purchase a SMSL M8 and thanks to the magic that is Amazon Prime, it's already here. In fact I've been playing with it for a few hours. But the main advantage of this DAC is it has support for DSD64 and DSD128, where my old DAC supported 96khz and 24-bit at most. I was no stranger to DSD in FB2k, but actual playback over ASIO was a new arena. I dove in and spent the next twenty minutes ripping </p>
