To enter the material names, I am manually opening each part or subassy and hitting FilegtPropertiesgtCustomgtselect "material" then type in the material. This takes a lot of time for larger assemblies. Is there an easier way? In ProEngineer/Creo, I was able to just create a column on the Feature Manager ("Model Tree") and just run down the list adding materials to the parts right in the assembly model. I was also able to modif. Состояние и перспективы развития рынка робототехники в мире и в России.

I am a Mechanical Engineer looking to take up some freelance work on the side (I have a 4-day work week). I would like to take on CAD work as well (I have experience with ProEngineer, SolidWorks and Solid Edge), but the standard licenses are prohibitively expensive for such a situation. I will be working for startups that don't have a hardware department with floating licenses to give out, and I won't be making tens of thousands a year to make paying the full price worth it.

Wondering what your experience was. Especially if you do a lot of 3D mechanical packaging in pro engineer, creo, solid works etc. Have you improved your designs?

I am a mechanical engineer with about a year and a half of experience in the oil industry. Degrees are bachelor's in aerospace and mechanical engineering. I'll be taking the FE on May 27th. In terms of software, I'm comfortable with SolidWorks, MATLAB, ANSYS, AutoDesk Inventor, the usual MS Office suite, and have recently begun experimenting with writing macros in Excel. I have some experience with Pro/Engineer, Creo, and AutoCad. I'm looking for advice on this build before I but the parts. I need a computer that could run Solidworks and ProEngineer/Creo. Will this be suitable? Any help is much appreciated.

I worked in heavy equipment and most recently was designing a 70 foot, 140,000 lb tractor-trailer spread. That project had me doing structural analysis, material selection, SolidWorks modeling, creating an expanded bill of materials, leading design reviews, writing operation manuals, and working with our manufacturing facility and vendors.

Hello everyone, I recently imported a STEP file of a Centrifugal Fan from a air pump motor. Problem is, is that while the Diameter is right, the height of the Rotor has to be increased as well. Is there a way to manipulate a STEP file within Creo Parametric like that? If so, could anyone help me do that and walk me through. A search on any job board shows much more demand for Creo rather Is this software encountered in the field Or would you recommend another CAD software? Noob here. Thank.

The more details the better. Used to play PC games around 10 years ago (CS:Source amp WoW). As I was young I gave my computer to a shop to build (excluding GPU amp RAM changes). Switched to Xbox so I could keep playing with my friends but we're all now planning on playing PC again. I work as an engineer, so having a PC that’s. So I’m an engineer that’s looking to slowly transition from mechanical engineering to industrial design (yes I have read the pinned post to this thread). I currently work in an appliance product design firm but and very locked into the technical side of things. I’m looking at building my portfolio and learning a few programs to help me get into the industry. I was wondering what you guys thought the most useful software programs would be? I currently use Creo PTC (previously Pro-E)
